# Rimstation13

A space station 13 based version of the game rimworld (http://rimworldgame.com/)

We do not claim ownership of rimworld, or affiliation with anyone involved, this is simply a fan based version using a /tgstation fork.

As mentioned above, code is originally based on [tgstation](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation) codebase.
